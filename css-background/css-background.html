        IN the midway of this our mortal life,
        I found me in a gloomy wood, astray
        Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell,
        It were no easy task, how savage wild
        That forest, how robust and rough its- growth,
        Which to remember only, my dismay
        Renews, in bitterness not far from death.
        Yet, to discourse of what there good befell,
        All else will I relate disc0ver'd there.
        How first I enter'd it I scarce can say,
        Such sleepy dulness in that instant weigh'd
        My senses dovm, when the true path Ileft;
        But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where closed
        The valley that had pierced my heart with dread,
        I l0ok'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad
        Already vested with that planet's beam,
        Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.
        Then was a little respite to the fear,
That in my heart's recesses deep had lain
All of that night, so pitifully past:
And as a man, with difficult short breath,
Forespent with toiling, scaped from sea to shore,
Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands
At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd,
Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits
That none hath past and lived. My weary frame
After short pause re-comforted, again
I journey'd on over that lonely steep,
The hinder foot still firmer. Scarce the ascent
Began, when, lo! appanther, nimble, light,
And cover'd with a speckled skin, appear'd ;
Nor, when it saw me, vanish'd; rather strove
To check my onward going; that ofttimes,
With purpose to retrace my steps, I turn'd.
The hour was morning's prime, and on his way Aloft the sun ascended with those starss
That with him rose when Love divine first moved
Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope
All things conspired to fill me, the gay skin“
Of that swift animal, the matin dawn,
And the sweet season. Soon that joy was chased,
And by new dread succeeded, when in view
A lion came, 'gainst me as it appear'd,
